## Answer 20: If PLG fails to generate leads, what is the pivot?

**Conclusion:** If the bottom-up PLG funnel fails to generate enterprise leads after 18 months, it signifies a failure in one of the core assumptions. The pivot is not to abandon the product, but to shift from a PLG-centric GTM to a more traditional, top-down **Sales-Led Growth (SLG) model**.

### Analysis:

A failure of the PLG funnel means that either:
a) The R&D/QA users are not adopting the tool (failure of Product-Market Fit).
b) The R&D/QA users are adopting the tool, but this is not translating into production interest (failure of the "Trojan Horse" assumption).

In either case, waiting for bottom-up adoption to drive enterprise sales is no longer a viable strategy.

1.  **The Pivot to Sales-Led Growth (SLG):**
    *   **Change in Target:** The primary target is no longer the individual engineer. It is the **enterprise buyer**—the Director of Network Engineering, the Head of Broadcast Operations, the OT Security Manager.
    *   **Change in Tactics:**
        *   **Outbound Sales:** Instead of waiting for PQLs, the company will build a list of target accounts in the Broadcast and OT sectors and engage in targeted, outbound sales prospecting.
        *   **Marketing Shift:** Content will shift from "how-to" tutorials for engineers to "business value" white papers and case studies for managers. The focus will be on ROI, security, and operational efficiency.
        *   **Product as a Demo Tool:** The product is no longer the primary driver of adoption. It is the tool used by the Sales Engineer in a formal sales process to demonstrate value to a prospective customer.

2.  **Implications of the Pivot:**
    *   **Team Structure:** The "first hire" is no longer a Developer Advocate. It is an experienced **Enterprise Account Executive** with contacts in the target industries. A Sales Engineer becomes the second critical hire.
    *   **Product Roadmap:** The priority of features may shift. Enterprise features like RBAC, audit logs, and compliance reports become more important than a frictionless self-service onboarding experience.
    *   **Funding:** This is a more expensive GTM model. It may require more capital to fund a sales team before significant revenue is generated.

3.  **When to Make the Call:** The decision to pivot should be data-driven. The V3 strategy should define the "failure condition" upfront. For example: "If, after 18 months and achieving 10,000 community downloads, we have fewer than 50 PQLs from enterprise accounts, we will initiate the pivot to a Sales-Led Growth model."

**Strategic Implication:** The V3 strategy must include this as a formal **Contingency Plan**. It demonstrates foresight and a clear-eyed understanding that the initial GTM strategy is a hypothesis, not a certainty. It provides investors and the team with a clear "Plan B" if the primary strategy does not yield the expected results.
