## Answer 8: What is the sales structure for converting PLG to enterprise?

**Conclusion:** The transition from a self-service PLG model to high-touch enterprise sales requires a specialized, hybrid team structure. A purely engineer-led approach will not succeed in closing large, complex deals.

### Analysis:

This process is often called "Product-Led Sales" (PLS) and requires a new set of roles and skills that augment the existing PLG motion.

1.  **The Team Structure:**
    *   **PLG/Growth Team:** This team remains focused on the bottom-up funnel: optimizing the website, improving the onboarding experience for the Community Edition, and generating Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs). They are measured on adoption and activation rates.
    *   **Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) / PQL Specialists:** This is the bridge. Their job is not cold calling. They receive the PQLs from the Growth team and their role is to enrich the data (who is this user, what is their company, what is their role?) and initiate a non-salesy, consultative conversation. The goal is to qualify the lead and book a meeting with an Account Executive.
    *   **Enterprise Account Executives (AEs):** These are not traditional software salespeople. They must be highly consultative and understand the technical and business challenges of the enterprise customer. They manage the complex, multi-stakeholder sales process, from the initial technical deep-dive to navigating procurement and legal.
    *   **Solutions Engineers (SEs):** The technical right hand of the AE. The SE is a deep product expert who runs the proof-of-concept, designs the production architecture, and builds trust with the customer's engineering team.

2.  **The Handoff:** The most critical part of the process is the handoff of a PQL from the automated PLG funnel to the human-led sales process. This is triggered by the PQL alerts (e.g., "5 users from Cisco have signed up this week and one of them is running 10+ relays").

3.  **Compensation:** The compensation model must align with the hybrid approach. The Growth team might be bonused on the number of PQLs generated, while the AEs and SEs are compensated on the value of the enterprise contracts they close.

**Strategic Implication:** The V3 strategy must detail this Product-Led Sales structure. It needs to move beyond the vague idea of "enterprise sales" and define the specific roles (PQL Specialists, AEs, SEs) and the process that connects the PLG funnel to the enterprise sales motion. This demonstrates a mature understanding of how to scale a bottom-up adoption model into a revenue-generating enterprise business.
