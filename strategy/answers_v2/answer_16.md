## Answer 16: Who is the ideal "first hire"?

**Conclusion:** For a PLG-driven, open-source company, the ideal first hire is a **Developer Advocate** (also known as a Community Manager or Developer Relations Engineer). This role is the linchpin that connects the product to the community, which is the engine of the entire GTM strategy.

### Analysis:

1.  **Why Not Sales or Marketing First?**
    *   **Traditional Sales:** A traditional salesperson would have no one to sell to. The PLG model requires a base of free users to generate PQLs. Hiring sales first is putting the cart before the horse.
    *   **Traditional Marketing:** A traditional marketer might focus on channels (like ads) and messaging that are ineffective or even counter-productive for a deeply technical, skeptical audience. Authentic, technical content is required, which is not typically a marketer's primary skill set.

2.  **The Role of the Developer Advocate:** This role is a hybrid of engineering, marketing, and support. Their responsibilities are perfectly aligned with the initial GTM phase:
    *   **Community Building:** Actively manage the GitHub repository, Discord/Slack channel, and other community forums. They are the welcoming, helpful face of the project.
    *   **Content Creation:** Write the deep-dive blog posts, create the video tutorials, and build the example projects that will attract the target R&D/QA persona. This requires hands-on technical skills.
    *   **Product Feedback Loop:** They are the "voice of the user" to the product team. They synthesize feedback from the community to help prioritize the roadmap and identify pain points.
    *   **Evangelism:** Speak at conferences and meetups, not as a salesperson, but as a technical expert sharing knowledge.

3.  **The Founding Team's Role:** In the very beginning, the founders will wear all hats. The CEO will be the primary salesperson, and the lead engineer will be the primary community support contact. The first hire is about offloading and professionalizing the most critical GTM function for a PLG motion, which is building and nurturing the community.

**Strategic Implication:** The V3 strategy's execution plan must reflect this. The "First 12-Month Plan" should explicitly state that **Hiring a Developer Advocate** is the top priority after securing seed funding. This demonstrates a clear understanding of how to execute a modern, developer-focused GTM strategy.
