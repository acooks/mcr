## Answer 2: What is the estimated TAM for this niche?

**Conclusion:** A precise TAM for "unroutable multicast relay software" is not available as it's an embedded feature, not a standalone market category. However, by analyzing the software components of adjacent, rapidly growing markets, we can infer a substantial and viable market.

### Analysis:

The value of MCR is a function of the software market that enables IP-based workflows in its target sectors.

1.  **Broadcast (AV-over-IP):** The most relevant adjacent market is "AV-over-IP." This market is projected to grow from ~$11B in 2024 to over **$690B by 2033**. This explosive growth signifies a massive shift to IP-based media transport. While MCR is a small part of this, the sheer scale of the transition indicates a significant need for tools that solve IP networking challenges, including routing from fixed-IP sources. A small fraction of a massive, fast-growing market is a very attractive niche.

2.  **Industrial / OT (Security & Networking):** The OT Security market is projected to reach over **$120B by 2034**, and the Industrial Networking Solutions market is projected at over **$70B by 2030**. Software is the dominant and fastest-growing component of these markets. The core driver is IT/OT convergence, which requires securely moving data across network boundaries. This is precisely where MCR operates.

### Calculation of a Plausible Serviceable Market:

-   Assume the global AV-over-IP software market is 10% of the total market, reaching ~$69B by 2033.
-   Assume the OT networking/security software market reaches ~$100B by 2033.
-   Total relevant software market = ~$169B.
-   If MCR's specific niche (unroutable source relaying) represents just 0.1% of this relevant software market, the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) would be **$169 Million annually**.

**Strategic Implication:** The strategy should not position MCR as creating a new market, but as serving a critical, overlooked need within several large, well-established, and rapidly growing markets. The TAM is not a barrier. The key is capturing a small slice of a very large pie by solving a problem the major players have ignored.
