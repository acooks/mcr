## Answer 19: What is the "Trojan Horse" strategy?

**Conclusion:** The "Trojan Horse" is the **R&D/QA Test Engineer persona**. The strategy is to get MCR adopted by test labs and individual developers within a target enterprise, prove its value in a low-risk environment, and then use that success story to expand into production use cases in the Broadcast or OT departments.

### Analysis:

1.  **Why the QA Engineer is the Perfect Entry Point:**
    *   **Low Risk:** A failure in a test lab has minimal consequences compared to a failure in production. This makes it much easier to get approval to try a new, unproven tool.
    *   **High Autonomy:** QA and R&D departments often have more autonomy to select and use their own tools compared to the highly regulated production environments.
    *   **Clear ROI:** The value proposition is simple and measurable: faster, more automated testing.
    *   **Natural Fit for Open Source:** This persona is highly likely to be comfortable with and actively seek out open-source developer tools.

2.  **The Expansion Path:**
    *   **Step 1: Infiltration (QA/R&D):** A QA engineer discovers the free MCR Community Edition and uses it to solve a testing problem. They find it reliable and easy to automate.
    *   **Step 2: Internal Evangelism:** The QA team's success becomes an internal case study. They might mention it to their colleagues in the operations or broadcast engineering teams: "We use this great little tool, MCR, to handle that weird multicast issue with the new XYZ device."
    *   **Step 3: Crossing the Chasm (Production):** When a production team (Broadcast or OT) faces a similar unroutable source problem, MCR is no longer an unknown, untrusted tool. It's "that thing the QA team uses." The conversation shifts from "should we try this unknown software?" to "can we get a supported, enterprise version of MCR for our production environment?"
    *   **Step 4: Enterprise Sale:** The production team now has a clear need for the features in the Professional or Enterprise edition (HA, support, etc.), creating a warm lead for a commercial sale.

**Strategic Implication:** The V2 strategy must explicitly define this adoption pathway. The entire GTM strategy (content marketing, community engagement) should be heavily weighted towards attracting and delighting the R&D/QA persona first. They are not just a target market; they are the key to unlocking the more lucrative, higher-pain enterprise markets.
