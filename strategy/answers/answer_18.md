## Answer 18: What does the support model look like?

**Conclusion:** The lack of a professional support model is a deal-breaker for enterprise users. The V2 strategy must define a clear, tiered support model that aligns with the Open Core business strategy.

### Analysis:

1.  **The Need for a "Throat to Choke":** For the Broadcast and OT personas, when a critical system fails, they need to know who to call. They are purchasing not just software, but assurance. A community forum is not an acceptable substitute for a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

2.  **Tiered Support Model:** The support model must align with the product tiers.
    *   **Community Edition:**
        *   **Support Channel:** Community-based support via GitHub Issues and a public forum/chat (e.g., Discord/Slack).
        *   **SLA:** None. Support is best-effort from the community and project maintainers.
        *   **Purpose:** Publicly demonstrates the responsiveness of the project and helps identify common issues.

    *   **Professional Edition:**
        *   **Support Channel:** Dedicated email support portal.
        *   **SLA:** Business hours support (e.g., 9am-5pm, Mon-Fri). Guaranteed response times (e.g., 8-hour first response).
        *   **Purpose:** Provides a reliable support channel for businesses running MCR in important but not life-or-death situations.

    *   **Enterprise Edition:**
        *   **Support Channel:** 24/7 phone and email support portal.
        *   **SLA:** Mission-critical support. Guaranteed response times (e.g., 1-hour first response for critical issues).
        *   **Additional Services:** Access to a dedicated support engineer, proactive health checks, and assistance with architecture and deployment planning.
        *   **Purpose:** Provides the assurance required for deploying MCR in the most critical environments (live broadcasts, factory control systems).

**Strategic Implication:** The V2 strategy must clearly document this tiered support model. It is a core part of the commercial product offering and a primary justification for the price difference between the Professional and Enterprise editions. The ability to offer a credible, 24/7 support contract is what allows MCR to transition from a "cool tool" to a trusted piece of enterprise infrastructure.
