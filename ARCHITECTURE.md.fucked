# Multicast Relay - Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the `multicast_relay` application. It is the definitive guide to the system's design, components, and core technical decisions.

## 1. Overview

The `multicast_relay` is a high-performance userspace application designed to solve the "unroutable source" problem for multicast traffic. It receives multicast UDP packets, which may originate from unroutable sources, and re-transmits them from a routable local interface.

The architecture is designed around three core principles:
1.  **Peak Performance:** To handle millions of packets per second by minimizing system calls, memory copies, and cross-core cache misses.
2.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** To allow for adding, removing, and monitoring forwarding flows at runtime without service interruption.
3.  **Testability:** To structure the code in a way that is modular and verifiable.
