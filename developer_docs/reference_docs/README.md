# Reference Documents (Historical & Archived)

This directory serves as a repository for historical documents, completed plans, experimental notes, and other reference material that is not part of the active, continuously updated developer documentation.

## Contents

-   **`archive/`:** Contains older versions of documents, previous investigations, and historical test reports.
-   **`completed/`:** Holds reports on completed phases of work and session summaries.
-   **`experiments/`:** Stores documentation related to small, standalone prototypes and in-depth investigations into specific technical challenges.
-   **`plans/`:** Contains historical or superseded development plans and work items.
-   **`reference/`:** May contain older general reference guides.

These documents are retained for historical context and debugging purposes but should not be considered the most current source of truth for MCR's architecture, design, or testing strategy.
