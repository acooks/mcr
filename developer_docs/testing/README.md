# Testing

This directory contains all documentation related to testing the Multicast Relay (MCR) application.

## The Comprehensive Guide

The primary document for all testing is the **[Practical Testing Guide](./PRACTICAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md)**.

This single, consolidated guide covers:
-   The high-level testing philosophy and tiered strategy.
-   The `just`-based workflow for building and running tests.
-   The technical implementation of our network namespace framework for privileged tests.
-   Practical commands for day-to-day development.

## Supporting Documents

These documents provide analysis and planning related to test coverage:

*   **[Test Coverage Analysis](./test_coverage_analysis.md):** A detailed analysis of current Rust code coverage.
*   **[Improvement Plan](./improvement_plan.md):** A pragmatic, prioritized action plan for systematically increasing test coverage.
