docs: Update STATUS.md with definitive egress regression root cause

Updates the `STATUS.md` to reflect the definitive root cause of the
~75% egress performance regression.

A `codebase_investigator` analysis, guided by the
`EGRESS_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS` report, has confirmed that the primary cause
was an architectural change to the `send_batch()` function in the egress
worker. The function was refactored from a synchronous submit-and-reap
model to a deferred-submission model, which broke the buffer pool
feedback loop and caused massive ingress buffer exhaustion.

The roadmap in `STATUS.md` has been updated to:
- State this architectural regression as the primary problem.
- Define the primary fix as reverting `send_batch()` to its synchronous model.
- Frame the pre-existing lack of tuning (`SO_SNDBUF`, `io_uring` depth) as
  a secondary optimization to be performed concurrently.

This makes the `STATUS.md` a precise and actionable guide for fixing the
critical performance issue.
