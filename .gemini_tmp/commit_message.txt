docs: Clarify AF_PACKET capability for unaddressed interfaces

Enhances the "Ingress Path (`io_uring` + `AF_PACKET`)" section in
`developer_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to explicitly state a key benefit of
`AF_PACKET`.

This update clarifies that `AF_PACKET` enables MCR to receive raw frames
even on network interfaces that **do not have an IP address assigned**.
This is crucial for network isolation scenarios and further justifies
MCR's low-level architectural choice.

This makes the documentation more precise and robust against potential
misunderstandings of `AF_PACKET`'s role.
