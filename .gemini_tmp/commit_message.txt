docs: Strengthen AF_PACKET justification in ARCHITECTURE.md

Enhances the "Ingress Path (`io_uring` + `AF_PACKET`)" section in
`developer_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to provide a more robust justification
for the architectural choice of `AF_PACKET`.

This update directly addresses potential concerns about bypassing the
kernel's IP stack by:
- Adding a problem statement that clarifies why a bypass is necessary for
  MCR's specific RPF-bypassing role.
- Emphasizing the granular control and raw access `AF_PACKET` provides,
  enabling custom Layer 2/3/4 processing.
- Acknowledging the trade-offs and explaining how MCR manages them (e.g.,
  by performing its own parsing and re-transmitting clean, compliant
  egress packets).

This makes the documentation more proactive in explaining the design
rationale and counters arguments regarding fragility or loss of kernel
benefits.
